A MultiThreaded Java Chat Program


About
=====


This project was started as part of a Java Programming course I took my senior year of high school at LSRHS (lsrhs.net).
It is purely an academic project that I use to learn new things and practice knowledge I have learned elsewhere.

If you would like to submit issues or use this for yourself you are more than welcome to do so :). It's free open source 
code for you to use however you like
